# Hello

My Name is Brent Pappas.
I am Computer Science PhD student at the University of Central Florida, where I am advised by Dr. Paul Gazzillo.
My research interests are in program analysis and transformation; more specifically, I am currently working on a tool for automatically transforming C function-like macros to C functions.
